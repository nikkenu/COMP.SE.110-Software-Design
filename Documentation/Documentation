## More detailed description

How data flows through the program:
Baseapihandler is inherited into fingrid- and fmihandlers which  
handle the api calls to Fingrid and Ilmatieteenlaitos respectively.  
Model consists of datahandler that gets the data from apihandlers and  
processes it ready for Chart. Chart processes data further ready to be  
shown in a graph. Main QML then gets the data from chart and shows it in a graph.

## Self-evaluation (midterm)

Since the prototype phase, we have added a new,  
improved high-level description that doesn't necessarily change anything,  
but describes it better and clearer. When it comes to what is implemented  
so far, we have gone fully according to our better description. And we would  
imagine that our design is what the end result will look like, but maybe  
smaller additions will come in the future that we haven't thought about.
